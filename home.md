# Welcome to FE_VER

FE_VER is my personal project, playground, and research archive for an ongoing exploration into **algorave, live coding, and generative music**.  
This blog will document my whole project throughout these weeks. From what im thinking to what im actually doing while experimenting.

## Who I Am

I am a creative person who gets excited about things that not many people know about. It's the little twists and turns that interest me, and that's how I came to this project. I have been a dancer all my life and have been listening to music since I was a child. What started with contemporary sounds has now blossomed into the underground scene: techno, acid, trance, etc.

Lately, rather than just listening, I’m drawn to:
- creating playlist to set the evening mood  
- combining beats and grooves  
- creating settings where people can have fun  

FE_VER started as a way to make sense of that curiosity.

## Why FE_VER?

I started this project because I thought being a DJ was cool. But I also noticed that everyone wants to do it these days, which immediately put me off the idea. The hardware is also too expensive for my savings to buy and then not use it anymore. I like to keep things original, and while scrolling through TikTok one evening, I came across the best solution: live coding & Algoraves.

Live coding appealed to me because:
- it's free and accessible  
- decisions happen in real time  
- people are intrigued at what they're seeing  

At the same time, the learning curve is steep.  
Tooling breaks. Documentation is incomplete. AI tools help… until they don’t.  
This blog exists to **document that friction honestly**.

FE_VER is an abbreviation of my own name: Febe Verelst

## What I’m Exploring

Throughout this project I experiment with:

- Live coding environments (currently Strudel)
- Algorithmic rhythm and melody
- The possibility of live audiovisual performance

Over time, the focus has started shifting from *just sound* toward **performance, embodiment, and interaction**.

## How This Blog Works

### 📅 Daily Log
My process is documented weekly. Each week contains:
- experiments and code studies  
- influences and references  
- reflections on what worked and what didn’t  


### 🧩 Code Snippets
Some experiments are worth keeping.  
The **Code Snippets** page collects reusable patterns, functions, and ideas I want to return to later.

## Goals for This Project

- Become fluent enough to improvise live with code
- Translate experimentation into live performance
- creating an accessible way for other people to start experimenting with strudel
