## 📝 January 7, 2026 - Project Setup

**What I Did:**
- Created the AlgoRave blog structure
- Set up dark, energetic theme with neon colors
- Implemented markdown-based logging system
- Created two main pages: Daily Log and Code Snippets

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Getting the perfect dark theme that feels energetic and mysterious
- Ensuring iframes can be embedded seamlessly in markdown

**Code Snippets Tested:**

<iframe src="https://strudel.cc/" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: 2px solid #8a2be2; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>

**Thoughts & Reflections:**
This blog system gives me a perfect way to track my AlgoRave journey. The dark purple and cyan aesthetic captures the mysterious, energetic vibe I'm going for. Being able to embed live code snippets directly in my documentation means I can experiment and test ideas right here while logging my progress.

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Create first experimental algortihmic piece
- [ ] Document interesting discovery patterns
- [ ] Build more complex compositions
- [ ] Test integration with live coding

## 🎵 Working with Live Code

To add your own code snippets to this blog, you can embed iframes like the one above. The Strudel editor loaded in the iframe lets you write and execute code directly. Here's the basic format:

```html
<iframe src="https://strudel.cc/" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
```

You can customize the height and width to fit your needs. Each iframe is independent, so you can have multiple code snippets on a single entry.

## 💡 Tips for Daily Logging

1. **Be specific** - Document exactly what you tried and what happened
2. **Include code** - Use the iframe embeds to show working examples
3. **Track challenges** - Write down problems so you can revisit solutions
4. **Reflect** - Take time to think about what you learned
5. **Plan ahead** - Set clear next steps for your sessions
