## <a id="week-1"></a>Week 1

This week I explored TidalCycles as a live-coding tool, but persistent installation issues made it difficult to use. The experience highlighted the importance of accessible, stable tools and revealed the limits of AI support for complex, real-time music systems.

## <a id="week-2"></a>Week 2

This week I focused on learning Strudel by recreating and modifying existing algorave examples, which helped me understand patterns, scales, and reusable functions more intuitively. I began composing faster, experimented with acid-style synthesis, and started thinking beyond sound toward live audiovisual performance and accessible performance setups.

## <a id="week-3"></a>Week 3

I focused on experimenting with algorave concepts in Strudel, combining sound patterns with ideas for live visuals and video filters. I developed several sessions, explored parameter-driven visuals, and received approval to continue the project without further consultation.

## <a id="week-4"></a>Week 4

This week was about practice and refinement through recording live-coding sessions and troubleshooting technical issues like internal audio capture. I improved my workflow, explored embedding the Strudel editor into my own project, and revisited earlier sessions to refine musical patterns and live performance techniques.

## <a id="week-5"></a>Week 5

I researched live-coded DJ performances and techno sets to better understand groove, crowd interaction, and structure. By analyzing other artists’ workflows, building my own drum stacks, and exploring visual tools like Hydra, I began connecting sound design, performance narrative, and audiovisual interaction more consciously.

## <a id="week-6"></a>Week 6

I focused on listening and analysis, studying how DJs and live coders use repetition, subtle variation, and visuals to sustain long-form performances. This week sharpened my understanding of structure, sampling, and the potential of visuals as an integrated performance element.

## <a id="week-7"></a>Week 7

This week I explored vocal sampling and samplers in Strudel, experimenting with expressive and traditional vocals in a techno context. I also established a fixed rhythmic base, which helped me work more freely with texture, melody, and energy flow.

## <a id="week-8"></a>Week 8

I worked ahead by researching documentation and experimenting with vocal samples, randomized patterns, and layered drum stacks. These sessions focused on controlled randomness, post-gain structuring, and live-adjustable energy for performance use.

## <a id="week-9"></a>Week 9

I refined my technical understanding of Strudel’s sampling system, including JSON-based samplers and localhost workflows. Alongside musical inspiration, I focused heavily on converting my blog to markdown and solving playback and embedding issues to improve documentation and presentation.

## <a id="week-10"></a>Week 10

This week I shifted focus toward visuals and structure, experimenting with Hydra, P5LIVE, and audio-reactive visuals synced to internal sound. Coaching feedback highlighted the need for clearer planning, which led to refining the Cookbook concept into performance-based sections and starting more intentional documentation. I also began integrating hardware by setting up an AKAI MPD226 MIDI controller and exploring its future use for live control, while continuing hands-on experimentation with Strudel, visuals, and workflow.

## <a id="week-11"></a>Week 11

This week I focused on making the project more usable and performative by tackling custom sample importing, building a dedicated Cookbook website, and finally getting the AKAI MPD226 to communicate properly with Strudel. After resolving MIDI control issues and refining my workflow, I experimented with acid techno patterns, vocal samples, and hands-on hardware control to shape more expressive live sets. Alongside continued musical exploration, I pushed the Cookbook forward by restructuring its content, expanding recipes, and consolidating everything into a clearer system for others to use.
