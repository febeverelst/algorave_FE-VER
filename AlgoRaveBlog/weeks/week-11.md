# Week 11: 19–25 January 2026

## Monday

I start the day with summarizing what I did previous week to adapt/improve my planning. 

### the proces

To import custom samples into your project you need to have and active github repo present. Since I already have mine for this project I created a new folder "Samples" where I could start importing my audio files. 

Because they come from _.mp4's_ I had to convert them to _.mp3's_, normally strudel should be able to read that. 

I created a JSON-file and added the paths to the audio samples in there.

Now with with import function we should be able to import the sound files into our strudelREPL and use those.

Looking at the side window on the user-tab showed me that the files are succesfully loaded in the REPL
