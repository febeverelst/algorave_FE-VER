### Hydra exploration

I started to delve deeper into the visual aspect of this performance and considered what could be included in the performance at the end of the project without it becoming visually overwhelming. The documented part of hydra in the strudel documentation is very minimal and I cannot deduce much from it. I started working with the available information and used an existing melody (created by myself) to experiment with.

 ### Coaching feedback

 During our coaching session, we reviewed my progress in the project, what I had already accomplished, and what the prospects were. We discovered that I have _many ideas_ in my head, but that there is _no concrete, written plan yet._ At the moment, I am enthusiastically experimenting at random, and that is still working, but in the coming weeks, I will definitely need to start finding some structure. 

Together, we drew up a short to-do list:
- Refine goal → too vague
	- Cookbook with recipes
- Planning 3.5 weeks → not super detailed
- Continue to document all the little things
	- What has been tried, what works, what doesn't, what will work?
- Think about visuals (end-to-end → low priority)

We looked at possibilities for the live performance together and came across a web-based P2P collaboration editor for live coding sounds and images called [FLOK](https://flok.cc/s/scared-ivory-cardinal-4eb6e111). We tried it out and you can use strude and hydra together on two different windows. Of course, this still doesn't solve the problem we have: now I have to code both visuals and sound when I really just want to focus on the music. But it's something to keep in mind.

After the consultation, my coach came up with the _AKAI MPD226, a USB MIDI pad controller_. I had already been thinking about using something like this because it gives more options in terms of sound control. And now that I have my hands on one im excited to start using it.


### Feedback Conclusions.

1. I need to have a very clear idea of what I want to include in the cookbook. Recipes for basslines, drum stacks, etc.

2. Make a not-so-detailed plan for the next three and a half weeks. Mainly a kind of overview so that I have an idea of what still needs to be done and happen.

3. The documentation is going in the right direction, but now it seems more like I'm just summarising at the end of the day. Every trial and error has to be included, otherwise it looks like I'm not doing anything, and that contradicts my toggle.

4. I don't need to worry about the visuals at the moment. I'll have enough work learning strudel and all the tricks of the trade.


### Current plan of Action

What I want to focus on today is writing things down in the blog that have been missing. Then I want to have my _idea of the cookbook fully written down_ (recipe ideas etc.) to be able to make a planning for myself and have an overview of my coming weeks. I also want to set up that _AKAI MPD226_ so that I know in the future how it works and that I won't have to struggle with connecting everything.

### AKAI MPD226

I didn't know how to get started with this device, so I just looked it up on Google. That's how I found this site: https://www.akaipro.com/usb-pad-controller-with-rgb.html

<img src="assets/images/week10_akaiDownload.png" alt="download page MPD226" width="30%">

I started downloading the accompanying software and [user guide](https://cdn.inmusicbrands.com/akai/attachments/MPD226/MPD226-User_Guide-v1.1.pdf), but quickly realised that it was very dense for people who have no experience with this type of hardware.

I really couldn't make anything from the interface and the user guide so i started looking at youtube tutorials to try and see if I could find anything there. I found a lot of reviews but not a lot of recent tutorials. The best one I could find was a tutorial from 8 years ago. I was a bit sceptical because that's a lot of outdated software and I didn't think it would be super benefitial

The video helped a bit but at the end I had to ask ChatGPT to help me and that gave me the following steps that made it very easy to install the pad controller:
1. Plug the MPD226 into your MacBook
2. Open GarageBand (default app on iOS)
	- Choose “Empty Project”
	- Select “Software Instrument”
	- Click Create
3. Load a drum instrument
	- Open Library
	- Choose a "Drum Kit"
4. Test the pads, 

The pads lit up, which meant they recognised the touch, but I didn't hear any sound. Fortunately, Jules was sitting opposite me and he told me that the pads probably had some kind of velocity coding (which was correct), so I just had to hit them harder. I tried that for a while, but then my fingers started to hurt, so I looked up how to adjust the sensitivity. After that, it was much more comfortable to work with.
