# The Cookbook & Recipes

## What is the Cookbook?

The Cookbook is a collection of **proven patterns, techniques, and creative solutions** from my live-coding journey. It's a practical reference guide that transforms experimental discoveries into reusable knowledge—organized, documented, and ready to remix.

Rather than keeping experiments scattered across different weeks, the Cookbook consolidates the most useful learnings into digestible **recipes**: step-by-step approaches to creating specific sounds, structures, or performance moments.


## What are Recipes?

A **recipe** is a focused, reproducible approach to achieving a creative goal in live coding. Each recipe includes:

- **The Goal**: What you're trying to create or achieve
- **The Ingredients**: Key Strudel functions, scales, and patterns
- **The Method**: Step-by-step instructions with code examples
- **The Variations**: Ways to adapt or remix the recipe for your own use
- **Notes & Tips**: Insights from experimentation


## Why a Cookbook?

Traditional documentation teaches *how* things work. A cookbook teaches *what to do* when you want to create something specific.

If you want to:
- Build a hypnotic bass line
- Layer drums with evolving complexity
- Create ambient textures
- Structure a 30-minute set with energy flow
- Develop call-and-response patterns

...you come to the Cookbook to find proven starting points.

## The Philosophy

The Cookbook exists because **live coding is about decision-making in real time**. The better you know your tools and techniques, the more present you can be with the moment. This isn't about following recipes blindly—it's about building muscle memory and intuition so you can trust your instincts when performing.
