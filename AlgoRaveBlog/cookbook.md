# The Cookbook

Check out the First edition of the FE_VER Cookbook! :)

The Cookbook is a collection of proven live-coding patterns from my Strudel performances. Both practical and reusable approaches for creating sounds, structures, and moments in a set.

It’s a shortcut from experimentation to performance:
less theory, more _“what do I use when I want this?”_

Rather than being organized like technical documentation, the Cookbook is structured around performance states, the kinds of decisions you make while playing live.

## Structure

The Cookbook is divided into chapters inspired by a meal, each representing a different role in a live set:

- _Entrées_: Foundational rhythms and core techno beats. The essential that establish tempo, and momentum.

- _Palate Cleanser_: Moments of reduction and contrast. Beatless textures, resets between heavier sections.

- _Main Course_: The identity of the set. From random melodies to structured formation of notes.

- _Sides_: Optional additions that enhance "flavor". Custom samples, accents, FX layers, and extra detail.

- _Dessert_: The cherries on top. Closing with some extra spice.

They aren’t meant to be followed in order. They’re states you can move between as a set evolves.

## Recipes

A recipe is a reproducible way to achieve a specific musical goal in performance.
Each recipe includes:

- _Goal_: what you’re trying to create
- _Ingredients_: key functions, patterns, or concepts
- _Method_: step-by-step code examples
- _Variations_: ways to remix, adapt, or extend the idea

Short, focused, and designed for live use.

## Why

Traditional docs explain *how things work*.  
The Cookbook helps you decide *what to do*.

Use it when you want to:
  
- Add evolving drum complexity  
- Create texture or atmosphere  
- Shape energy across a set  
- Use your own external audio files   


## Philosophy

Live coding is about **decision-making in real time**.  
The better your muscle memory, the more present you can be on stage.  
The Cookbook isn’t about following rules but about freeing your attention so you can *listen, react, and perform*.
