# Week 1: 3 – 9 November 2025

### First Steps & Friction
**Focus:** Orientation, tooling research, and first encounters with live coding environments


## Exploring TidalCycles

This week I started by researching **TidalCycles** as a potential live-coding environment for algorithmic music. TidalCycles is a well-established system within the algorave community and seemed like a strong candidate for deeper exploration.

### Resources
- 📘 Official bootstrap / README:  
  https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-bootstrap
- 📄 macOS installation guide:  
  https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/macos_install#manual-installation


## Installation Attempt

I followed the **automatic installation** instructions from the TidalCycles GitHub README and later cross-checked with the **manual macOS installation guide**.

- The installation process *appeared* to complete successfully  
- All required software seemed to be installed  
- However, when attempting to start TidalCycles, I consistently encountered errors

### Issues Encountered
- The program fails to start properly
- Multiple error messages appear on launch
- According to ChatGPT, the issue might be related to **too many files loading at once**
- Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to resolve the issue

At this stage, the setup felt fragile and difficult to debug, especially as a first-time user.


## Reflections on AI Assistance

During troubleshooting, I relied heavily on ChatGPT and other AI tools for guidance. While these tools were useful for general explanations, they quickly reached their limits when dealing with:

- Complex audio toolchains  
- Real-time systems  
- Non-trivial installation errors  

> **Personal note:**  
> *ChatGPT (and other AI tools) have absolutely no rhythm.*  
>  
> The advice often felt generic or disconnected from the actual musical and technical context. This was a frustrating but important realization: **live coding and music require embodied, experiential understanding**, not just textual explanations.



## Reflections & Takeaways

- TidalCycles is powerful, but has a **steep and fragile setup process**
- Tooling friction can heavily influence creative momentum
- AI tools are helpful for orientation, but not a replacement for:
  - community knowledge
  - hands-on experimentation
- This experience made me more aware of the importance of **accessibility and immediacy** in live-coding tools



## Next Steps

- Pause work with TidalCycles for now
- Explore alternative environments with:
  - easier setup
  - immediate feedback
  - browser-based interaction
- Continue documenting both **technical progress** and **emotional/creative responses**
