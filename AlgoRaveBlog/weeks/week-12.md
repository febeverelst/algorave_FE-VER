# Week 12: 26 January – 1 February 2026

## Monday

From this day on I have 2 more weeks left to finish this project. But idealy i would like to mostly finish this project by Friday, Januray 30th.
For next week I'd like to just focus on preforming and setting a solid performance. I only have 15 minutes to present my whole project to the jury so I'd have to be very considerate of everything that I want to show.

### A Trance set a day, Keeps the Doctor Away
I was just having some fun here to start the day so excuse me if some parts sound very choppy.

### Planning
Last week was a bit of a let down on my part. I wasn't as productive as the past ones eventhough I worked at school all the time. I had a very hard time focussing so I hope that will get better this week. So my on my first working hour this week I took some time to plan everything to make sure that I'd be done on time
