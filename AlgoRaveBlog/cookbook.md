# The Cookbook

The Cookbook is a collection of **proven live-coding patterns** from my Strudel performances that are practical, reusable approaches for creating sounds, structures, and moments in a set.

Think of it as a shortcut from experimentation to performance:  
less theory, more *“what do I type when I want this?”*


## Recipes

A **recipe** is a reproducible way to achieve a specific musical goal.  
Each one includes:

- **Goal:** What you’re trying to create  
- **Ingredients:** Key functions, patterns, or concepts  
- **Method:** Step-by-step code examples  
- **Variations:** Ways to remix or extend it  

Short, focused, and designed for live use.


## Why Use the Cookbook?

Traditional docs explain *how things work*.  
The Cookbook helps you decide *what to do*.

Use it when you want to:
  
- Add evolving drum complexity  
- Create texture or atmosphere  
- Shape energy across a set  
- Use your own external audio files  


## How to Use It

1. Find a recipe by **goal**  
2. Try it live  
3. Remix it  
4. Add your own discoveries  

Each recipe links back to the **Daily Log**, connecting raw experimentation to refined technique.

## Philosophy

Live coding is about **decision-making in real time**.  
The better your muscle memory, the more present you can be on stage.  
The Cookbook isn’t about following rules — it’s about freeing your attention so you can *listen, react, and perform*.
