# algorave_FE-VER
A livecoding performance project built with Strudel, documenting my experiments and technical progress. This repo tracks my journey into the underground algorave scene—coding sound, visuals, and tools from scratch as I shape the FE_VER identity and build a full coded rave set.

## Project Documentation

This repository logs my process of building an algorithmic audio-visual performance using Strudel and livecoding tools.  
Since Strudel is open-source and currently browser-based, most of my early work has focused on learning the environment, experimenting with patterns, and documenting my progress outside of traditional code files.

For now, my most detailed weekly documentation lives on Notion. You can follow the full development blog here:

As the project evolves and I transition into writing more custom code in VS Code—especially for performance tools, sketches, and system development—this GitHub repo will gain more frequent technical updates, commits, and code versions.

This space will eventually become the main home for my ongoing coding, experiments, and performance-building process.
