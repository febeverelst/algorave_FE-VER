# Week 6: 8–14 December 2025

## Monday

A big inspiration for me these past few weeks has been **KI/KI**. She’s a Dutch DJ who is deeply passionate about **acid and trance**. I’ve been listening a lot to her set from **AMF 2025 (Amsterdam Music Festival)**.

What really stands out to me is how she shows that you can play a track for quite a long time using the same base idea **without it becoming boring**. The *hum* she uses around **40 minutes** into her set is something I need to remember. I can imagine doing some really interesting things with a similar sound inside Strudel.

### Short-form inspiration

While browsing YouTube, I noticed that a lot of these live-coding or modular-style shorts are using **localhost** as a sampler source. This really caught my attention, and I definitely want to look more into what that means and how it works, especially how it could be used inside a live performance setup.

I started looking more deeply into the use of samples in Strudel that you can use. Almost every ‘professional DJ’ who works with Strudel uses them, so I think they really add enormous value. I haven't watched this video all the way through yet (because I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis), but I'll definitely keep this in mind for the four weeks of the passion project.

### Visuals & Hydra

I also found a longer video that dives deeper into **Hydra**, showing how it can be used as a visual layer alongside live-coded sound.

This led me to a simple project demonstrating **Hydra as a visual instrument**, which made me think more seriously about integrating visuals as a core part of my FE_VER performances rather than treating them as an add-on.

This week mainly focused on **listening, observing, and analysing** how repetition, minimal changes, and visuals can keep long-form performances engaging. These insights feel especially relevant as I start shaping the narrative and structure of my own jury set.
